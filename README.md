# Isochrone and Isodistance with Google Maps API

Reboot of https://github.com/sandropaganotti-zz/isochrone-with-google-map for latest Google API

Isochrone is a polygon representing how far you would go from a single point in every direction, following each road. It's the best way to find out where you should live if you want to be «at most 5 minutes away from a tube station».
Isodistance is similar, but takes into account the median speed of roads (doesn't apply for pedestrian for example).

- allow to choose between isochrone (same duration) and isodistance (same distance)
